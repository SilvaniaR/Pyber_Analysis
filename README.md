# Pyber_Analysis
Matplotlib

# Overview of the analysis:
As a new employee at Pyber a ride sharing application,omar was aked to look at the data gathered by ridesahring application by city, drivers and fares.based on these three focus Omar must conduct a analysis by filtering and then graphinng the data to see if there are any patterns.

# Results:
After anylizing the data we noticed that urban area had the most total rides, total drivers, and total fares. This may be due to the urban area popultation being more dense, therefore higher demand for ride sharing. On the other hand when you looke at the suburban and rural, the totals decrease as the space between neighbors increased or as population number decreased. Suburban was in the middle and rural at the bottom of all totals. Another result that shall not remain unnotice is during a week in Feburary, all three citys had a peek in ridesahring as seen in figure 8 below;

# Summary:
In summary, we can see a obvious disparities between all three cities, but this anlysis does not really answers the question why? I would fisrt recommend to the CEO to do further reasearch to see the total populations for each city. Another disparity noticed was the avg price per fare by city. Rural had the highest avg fare price vs Urban who had the cheapest, this may indicate two things population totals vs demsand for ride sharing. I would also recommend the ceo to do a cost analysis by city, to see how much is it costing the company to keep the business going in those areass. If cost is higher than total revenue that would be a decesion point for the CEO. Along with a cost analysis i would also recommend a ride sharing demand analysis by city as well. These analysis will help the company make decision to maximize profits and perhaps cut cost. Thus the three things i would recommend the CEO are population ananlysis, ride sharing demand analysis and cost analysis by city. These anaylysis along with the one that we just conducted will help the CEO make a more certain decision.
